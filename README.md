Welnance is a protocol on the Binance Smart Chain that establishes money markets, which are pools of assets with algorithmically derived interest rates, based on the supply and demand for the asset. Suppliers(and borrowers) of an asset interact directly with the protocol, earning (and paying) a floating interest rate, without having to negotiate terms such as maturity, interest rate, or collateral with a peer or counterparty.

According to the meeting with Sea Binance Team, We have a collaboration with the BSC team (Ref Telegram Users: @BrettBinance @Jessbinance, @bibiapac, @lynnhoang). So we would like to submit our project to Trustwallet for more business collaborations BSC and Trustwallet. Furthermore, Welnance is already registered Binance corporate account: Welnance Trading Online Sole Co., Ltd
